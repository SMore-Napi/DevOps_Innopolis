- File contents from both pods
- `kubectl exec app-python-charts-app-python-0 -- cat /app/data/visits.json`

```bash
{"total_number": 5, "visits": ["2022-11-29 01:51:00 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:04 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:06 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:13 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:14 MSK+0300"]}
```

- `kubectl exec app-python-charts-app-python-1 -- cat /app/data/visits.json`

```bash
{"total_number": 4, "visits": ["2022-11-29 01:51:05 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:07 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:11 MSK+0300", "2022-11-29 01:51:12 MSK+0300"]}
```

- We can see that each timestamp is written only in `visits.json` file, so every request is handled only by one pod.
  each `visits.json` file is accessed only by one pod since each of them has own separate volume.
  Requests are distributed more or less equally between pods.
  We can say that pods work independently from each other because they use their own storage file
  and incoming requests are handled by the load balancer which decides which pod to assign.
  Therefore, such pods can work in parallel. That's why we can set `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"`.

## Reading

**Update strategies** helps us to apply new changes to the running pods, so keep them up to date.

- **Rolling update strategy** - iterate through outdated pods and replace them one by one.
  For each pod it deploys a new one and switches to it.
- **Recreate update strategy** - deactivates all outdated pods at once. Then deploys new pods.
- **Canary update strategy** - it deploys a small part of new pods to check and test them in the production.
  Then increase the number of new pods (deploy the new ones) and decrease the number of old pods (deactivate them).

- Commons: all strategies are related to the pods deployment
- Diffs: they use different approaches in terms of the number of pods that should be replaced at the same time.
