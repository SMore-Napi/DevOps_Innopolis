## Visits

- I created endpoint `/visits`
- `total_number` - the total number of times the `/` endpoint was called
- `visits` - list of timestamps each time when the `/` endpoint was called
- In this example, I opened `/` endpoint 3 times and then opened `/visits`.

## Readings

- StatefulSet - helps to keep an updatable storage in a pod.
  It can be used for a stateful server. For example for an FTP server
  which stores files.
- Headless service - service which does not have an IP and is not included in
  load balancing. It can be used to be hidden from K8S and not be maintained by it.
- Persistent Volumes - a special resource which acts like an "adapter" between
  actual storage and users. It can be used to hide details of how the storage is
  provided. For example, we can use the "Flyweight" pattern to simplify the way
  of how users interact with the storage.
